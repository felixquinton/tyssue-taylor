The csv files synth_model are used by the notebook Display synthetic model results.
They contain the data from the synthetic model run. 50 numerical instances were randomly created for each value of the standard deviation.
The moving_L0 file contain the result from the experiment in which we move the initial line tensions. This experiment test the smoothness of the optimization problem.
The moving_X file contain the result from the experiment in which we move the coordinates of the organoid. This experiment test the robustness of the optimization procedure to segmentation (ie 
image processing) errors.
